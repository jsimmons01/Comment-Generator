-The user will open the app and see a form for student information. They will also see directions (text) explaining how to use the app.

-After the user puts in the student information and press the submit button, a comment will be generated.

-The comment that is chosen will be selected based on the students level.

-When the correct comment is chosen, the student’s name and gender pronouns will be inserted into the comment.

-The user will see the new comment appear with the student’s information on it.

-I will start off with three levels, below, on, and above to get started.

-Eventually, I want to incorporate more, but not quite sure how I will implement it yet.

-I also want to implement a new page (will have to use nav) to present teacher resources

Student info is a component.

Comment will be a component that takes in student info.

Home will be the component that displays what is on the first page

Teacher resource component will display some info and a list of help links for teachers with a brief description. This maybe even nice if they are no cards with the links logo

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
